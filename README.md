# Stock-market-price-prediction

in this project, we'll try predicting the future stock price of any company that is listed at https://www.nseindia.com/ . But in order to do so, we'll have to 
find suitable machine learning models that would help us in predicting the price. In this project we'll test a few models and find the model which gives the best accuracy and use 
that model to predict the future stock price. We will also create a website for this project as well.


**In this project, we will:**
- create a website using python, django, HTML and CSS
- apply KNN, Moving average, linear regression and LSTM models on the stock dataset
- we will find the model that gives the best accuracy
- use that particular model to find the future stock price
